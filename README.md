### Description

Our Goal is to explore the relationship/pattern between energy consumption and external temperature conditions, to help predict and manage the future of energy distribution and placate energy demand.
Our Motivation: nncreasing energy consumption is one of the major contributors to greenhouse gases causing Climate Change. According to United Nations Environment Programme residential and commercial buildings consume approximately 60% of the world’s electricity and about 40% of global energy1. Therefore, it is critical to understand the consumption patterns and factors impacting it. 



### Research questions 
How weather and income influences hourly energy consumption? 
Is it possible to predict energy consumption given information about the weather, time stamp and household income? 
Can we predict a household’s income level based on their energy consumption pattern?
